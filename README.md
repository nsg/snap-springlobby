[Spring Engine](https://springrts.com) is a wonderful RTS game, designed
after the classic [Total Annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation)
game.

The lobby is used to download the actual game binaries, maps, mods and so on.

## Tips

* A easy way to download a mod or map to test the game, just select "Battlelist" and right click a game and select "Download map" and "Download game". You can now try out the game with a mod and map under Singleplayer.
